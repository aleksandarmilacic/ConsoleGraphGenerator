# ConsoleGraphGenerator

ConsoleGraphGenerator is a simple console application that allows you to generate and plot a graph of a mathematical function.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the compiled binary.

2. Enter a function in terms of 'x' when prompted. For example: `2 * x + 3`.

3. Enter the start value for 'x'. This represents the starting point on the x-axis for plotting the graph.

4. Enter the end value for 'x'. This represents the ending point on the x-axis for plotting the graph.

5. The program will generate the graph and save it as a PNG image file named "function.png" in the program directory.

6. The generated graph will be opened in your default image viewer.
